3.  The Doubao large model just got a serious upgrade in the programming world, officially launching the **Doubao-Seed-Code** model, deeply optimized for **Agentic programming**. This model not only supports an ultra-long **256K context** but also pioneers visual comprehension capabilities! It can directly understand UI design mockups and even hand-drawn sketches to generate code ✨. [According to this introduction (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6912e30d0cc646ee8dac2ea0), paired with a new monthly subscription model, this is practically a Swiss Army knife for developers, boosting efficiency and cutting costs 🛠️.

### Frontier Research

1.  The new **Sekai** dataset is here to rescue you from the struggle of lacking data for training video generation models! 🌟 It's like an "AI's virtual Earth exploration logbook." This [latest research findings (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15675) contains over **5000 hours** of first-person perspective videos from more than 100 countries worldwide, complete with rich annotations for scenes, weather, and trajectories. Its arrival will significantly boost the development of world models and interactive exploration technologies, helping AI truly "see" and understand the world 🌍.

2.  How can we get AI agents to learn from their mistakes, just like us? 🤔 The **FLEX** paradigm, proposed in [A new paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06449), offers an answer! It allows LLM agents to continuously evolve without retraining, simply by reflecting on their successes and failures 🧠. This "experiential learning" mechanism has led to performance improvements of up to 23% for AI in tasks like mathematical reasoning and chemical synthesis, marking a crucial step towards scalable, inheritable agent evolution 🚀.

3.  Image restoration isn't just guesswork anymore – now we can teach AI some physics! 🤯 Researchers have come up with an [Innovative Image Deblurring Method (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06244) that embeds **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** from physics into deep learning architectures. By simulating the "flow" characteristics of motion blur, the model can better understand and restore images. It achieves visually noticeable image quality improvements with a tiny 1% increase in computational cost, opening up new directions for physics-inspired AI design 💡.

4.  How can autonomous driving tests avoid being "deceived" by simulators? 🤔 The **MultiSim** method, proposed in [A study (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08936), is like bringing in a "jury" for autonomous driving systems! 🛡️ It identifies common system flaws—those not specific to a single simulator environment—by testing simultaneously across multiple different simulators. This "integrated testing" approach can boost the efficiency of finding real faults by an average of 66%, making test results much more trustworthy ✅.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Majestic Labs**, founded by three chip veterans from Google and Meta, recently raked in $100 million in funding. Their goal? To build AI servers with a mind-blowing **1000x** the capacity of traditional servers! 🤯 Their ambition isn't to replace GPUs, but to tackle the memory bottleneck, compressing the compute power of up to ten server racks into a single machine. This is pure "space magic" for data centers, aiming to cut costs and boost efficiency for AI-era infrastructure. [Click to learn about this startup's background (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22715) 🚀.

2.  AI education is undergoing a profound transformation, shifting from "giving a fish" to "teaching how to fish." Future AI won't just be a simple answer machine, but a "mentor" guiding kids to think actively 💡. Xueersi's **"Xiaosi AI 1-on-1"** is a fantastic example. Using multimodal perception technology, it can understand a child's scratchpad workings and provide step-by-step guided instruction. This [model of returning the thinking process to students (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247841143&idx=1&sn=cb268ef9420fdd6a3d7b8203cb32d67c) might just be the right way for AI to ignite the flames of education 🔥.<br/>![AI News: AI Teacher Guided Instruction](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k9sqdkphfgp8gwjmq7bd3dwm.gif)<br/>![AI News: AI Education Paper-Screen Interaction](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k9sqehgbffvbphebw6x4vtt2.gif)

3.  Where's the next frontier for AI? 🤔 Turing Award winner **Fei-Fei Li** has the answer: **spatial intelligence**! 🌟 In her [latest sharing (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1987970041498009773), she points out that current LLMs are like "wordsmiths in the dark," articulate but not grounded in reality. Future AI must build "world models" that understand the physical world, transforming perception into action to truly empower robotics, scientific discovery, and fundamentally improve human life 🌍.<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k9sqf4bnekgvsv4tr7qx2a3j.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>
