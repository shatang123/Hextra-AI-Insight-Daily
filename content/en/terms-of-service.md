# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into our services, please give these Terms of Service a careful read. By accessing or using our Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Intro
We offer users paid subscription content and membership services, like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To register for an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set a password.
- You're responsible for keeping your account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **don't transfer or share your account** – it's a big no-no.
- If you mess up and violate these terms, we've got the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see the fees clearly listed on the checkout page. No surprises there!
- All payments go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we **do not store** your payment info ourselves.
- Your subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want it to continue.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked about our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the email address at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads-up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or for any non-first-time subscriptions, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law literally makes us.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission – seriously, don't.
- You get **a non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content for your personal learning and reading only. Keep it to yourself, alright?
- If you're thinking about using it commercially or quoting extensively, just reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **You absolutely cannot** upload, publish, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or messes with anyone else's rights.
- **And seriously, no bulk downloading, crawling, or cracking** our member content with sneaky technical tricks.
- If we spot any inappropriate content, we've got the right to yank it and **ban users who break the rules** – plain and simple.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up! We can change, suspend, or even shut down parts or all of our services anytime, without giving you a prior heads-up.
- If stuff goes temporarily offline because of something out of our control (like an act of God, server hiccups, or third-party service issues), we're **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer
- What we share here is totally for reference only and **isn't** professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Seriously, don't take it as such!
- We're **not liable** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and will be interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without giving a second thought to its conflict of law principles.
- Got a disagreement or issue related to these terms? We'll try to work it out with some friendly negotiation first, between you and us. If we can't smooth things over that way, you agree that any legal action will be brought in the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
